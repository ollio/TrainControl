============

LEGO Train Control - Control a LEGO Power Functions train with an Android phone

Setup
=====

Arduino
-------

I have used the https://robosavvy.com/store/dagu-arduino-mini-motor-driver-control-board.html and a bluetooth modul.
Load the MotorDriver.ino onto the DAGU board.
Change the name of the train in the ino file.

Smartphone
----------

Link the bluetooth module with the smartphone. The default bluetooth pin is 1234.
Build the app, load it to the phone and choose the train from the drop down menu.
